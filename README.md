Flask is a lightweight and minimalistic web framework for Python, often referred
to as a "micro" framework. It provides the essential tools for web development
while allowing developers to choose their preferred components and libraries.
Flask is extensible, has a built-in development server, and is ideal for small
to medium-sized web projects.

- <b>Micro Framework:</b> Flask is a "micro" framework because it provides the
basic tools and features needed for web development without having a strict
structure or set of dependencies.<br>
<br>
- <b>Extensible and Modular:</b> Flask is very extensible and allows us to add
  features and functionality through a wide range of extensions and third-party
  libraries.<br>
  <br>
- <b>Built-in Development Server:</b> Flask comes with a built-in development
   server, making it easy to get started developing without the need for
   additional setup.
   > This server is suitable for development purposes but not
   recommended for production use.
